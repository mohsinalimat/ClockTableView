![Animate those labels](https://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-1-111b072f60.gif)

I noticed that Apple's own Clock.app doesn't animate the toggle of the UISwitch's when enabling/disabling alarms. I wonders if there was a technical reason for this? It was suggested on Twitter that this could be due to the fact you can't animate the colour of a UILabel, and thus no animation was better than some animation.

This project shows that, in this instance at least, you can animate the colour of the labels. This repo is for demonstration purposes only.
